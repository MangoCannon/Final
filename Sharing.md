# Sharing your repository

There are many ways to share your repository especailly if it is a public file as this allows anyone to search for it on GitHub or a search engine and find your page. But if you have set it as private or wish to directly give someone a link or clone of your repository you can do that as well. 

To do so navigate to the top of your repositoy and look for the green "Code" button and make sure the "HTTPS" option is selected, to get a url that allows someone to view your page when following the link. This is the ost direct way of sharing your repository as it will allow them to see the current status of your page unlike other methods of sharing.

But if you are only interesed in showing a snapshot of your page or need to save it and view it without the internet you can select the "Download Zip" option as this will download your page that can be opened in the GitHub desktop app either in offline or online mode. This is useful if you are going to travel and will not have interent or if you want to keep ypur work offline until it is a bit more polsihed. But this does not allow others to view your changes real time so it is not advised when working with others on a project.
