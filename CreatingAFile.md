# Creating a Markdown File

Creating a markdown page on GitHub is a simple task that anyone with a computer can do in just a few minutes, these pages can be used for all sorts of simple webpages that can host any sort of information you desire. 

The first steps are to create an account on GitHub, only a basic account is needed there is no need to pay for any special services

Once you have created you account you need to create your first repository, on the home page looking at the top left corner there will be a green "New" button, clicking this will start he process and take you to the creation page. 
On the creation page there is an area to name your repository, a description area, and a few tick boxes for certain settings, the only settings to focus on are the public/private setting, and ticking the Readme.Md file so that one is created in your repository and can serve as the base for your page or pages. 

To create a new markdown page within this repository look at the top of the middle of the page, and click the "AddFile" button and select the "Create new file" option, once on this new page think of a simple name but give it the file extension of ".md" for example "CoolCatFacts.md" 

 You can create many different markdown pages within a simple repository coving different topics, or different parts of one larger topic linked together.
