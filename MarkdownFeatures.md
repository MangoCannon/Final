#Markdown Features

There are many different features one can do in a markdown file, many common thins one would expect like **bolding**, *Italics* and others, to do these features you use common symbols like * > -

While there are other features that can be added to different markdown services this will only cover the basics that are commonly offered on all markdown services.

- Headings
Headings are used for titles of pages or tiles of a different section, there are different levels of heading that can be used within a page. The # denotes a heading, adding more than one # can be used to get different levels of heading with one # being the largest. 
> # Heading
> "# Heading"
> ## Heading
> "## Heading"

- Bolding
Bolding certain words or sentences can help emphasize the importance of those words and help direct a readerâ€™s attention down a page. It can be done with two * before and after the word or phrase you with to be bold.
>You can use **bold** words to help **attract attention** to certain parts of a sentence.
>
>"You can use ** bold ** words to help ** attract attention ** to certain parts of a sentence."

- Italics
Italics can be used for many things, like quotes or simply putting emphasis on words like bold is, it is done by using only one * before and after the words or phrase you want to be italicized.
>You can use *italic* words to help *attract attention* to certain parts of a sentence.
>
>"You can use * italic * words to help * attract attention * to certain parts of a sentence."

- Lists
There are two styles of lists to use, ordered lists using numbers or unordered lists that use bullets, you can additionally use any sort of list you like while creating a page but these two format the page differently than creating your own listing option would.
>- Unordered
>1. Ordered
>
>"- Unordered"
>"1. Ordered"

- Block Quotes
Block quotes are used to create a smaller block of text often used to help explain more on a topic or to show examples like I have used on this page, you can have block quotes inside of others but it can become distracting if used to much. It is created by using > in front of what you are trying to put into the block, and repeated when putting a block within a block.
> >Block quote
> 
> ">Block quote"

- Escaping Characters
Escaping characters is used to cancel the formatting that would happen when using a markdown feature. However, this only cancels the first symbol and cannot be used to cancel formatting that uses two symbols like bold.

> \**Bolding**
> 
> \*Italics*
> 
> " \** Bolding **"
> 
>  " \* Italics *"
 

- Image Linking
Creating a link to an image found online is an easy task as markdown allows the usage of some html formatting as well, to add an image from online all you need to do is use <img src="url of the image you are trying to add">. 
> <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/600x315/72/3f/c2/723fc2951c7b8daae1d8715b99ca5ef5.jpg">
> 
> "\<img src="https://i.pinimg.com/600x315/72/3f/c2/723fc2951c7b8daae1d8715b99ca5ef5.jpg">"


- Dividing Lines
Dividing lines can be used to start a new topic without the use of a header, it creates a simple line across the page to be used as a divider. It is created by using three * in a line with nothing else on that line of the markdown page code.
***
> "***"


These are most of the basic features offered on markdown pages, hyperlinks are also possible but will be covered in the next section.
