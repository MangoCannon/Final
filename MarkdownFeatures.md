While there are other featueres that can be added to differnt markdown services this will only cover the basics that are commonly offered on all markdown services.

- Headings
Headings are used for titles of pages or tiles of a differnt section, there are diffent levels of heading that can be used within a page. The # denotes a heading, adding more than one # can be used to get differnt levels of heading with one # being the largest. 
> # Heading
> "# Heading"
> ## Heading
> "## Heading"

- Bolding
Bolding certian words or sentences can help emphisize the importance of those words and help direct a readers attention down a page. It can be done with two * before and after the word or phrse you with to be bold.
>You can use **bold** words to help **attract attention** to certian parts of a sentence.
>
>"You can use ** bold ** words to help ** attract attention ** to certian parts of a sentence."

- Italics
Italics can be used for many things, like quotes or simply putting emphisis on words like bold is, it is done by using only one * before and after the words or phrase you want to be itiliczed.
>You can use *italic* words to help *attract attention* to certian parts of a sentence.
>
>"You can use * italic * words to help * attract attention * to certian parts of a sentence."

- Lists
There are two styles of lists to use, ordered lists using numbers or unordered lists that use bullets, you can additonally use any sort of list you like while creating a page but these two format the page differntly than creating your own listing option would.
>- Unordered
>1. Ordered
>
>"- Unordered"
>"1. Ordered"

- Block Quotes
Block qutoes are used to create a smaller block of text often used to help explain more on a topic or to show examples like I have used on this page, you can have block qutoes inside of others but it can become distracting if used to much. It is created by using > infront of what you are trying to put into the block, and repeated when putting a block within a block.
> >Block quote
> 
> ">Block quote"

- Escaping Charcters
Escaping characters is used to cancel the formating that would happen when using a markdown feature. However this only cancels the first symbol and cannot be used to cancel formatting that uses two symbols like bold.

> \**Bolding**
> 
> \*Italics*
> 
> " \** Bolding **"
> 
>  " \* Italics *"
 

- Image Linking
Creating a link to an image found online is an easy task as markdown allows the useage of some html formating as well, to add an image fron online all you need to do is use <img src="url of the image you are trying to add">. 
> <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/600x315/72/3f/c2/723fc2951c7b8daae1d8715b99ca5ef5.jpg">
> 
> "\<img src="https://i.pinimg.com/600x315/72/3f/c2/723fc2951c7b8daae1d8715b99ca5ef5.jpg">"


- Dividing Lines
Dividing lines can be used to start a new topic without the use of a header, it creates a simple line accross the page to be used as a divider. It is created by using three * in a line with nothing else on that line of the markdown page code.
***
